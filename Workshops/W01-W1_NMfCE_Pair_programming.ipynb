    "## What is pair programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "During the workshops you will work in pairs on the programming tasks, using a method called pair programming. It's a collaboration technique very popular in programming and part of the Agile Programming manifesto. Basically almost everything good in programming came out of the Agile Programming manifesto.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How does pair programming work__\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pair Programming there are two roles: Driver and Navigator. You and your partner will take turns driving, and will change every 10-15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Driver: Person who types on the keyboard and uses the mouse. You write in the notebook\n",
    "    - You will have the code opened in front of you and will be sharing your screen.\n",
    "    - Your job is to think out loud as you read the notes and solve the exercises.\n",
    "    - Your job is to talk the navigator through solving the puzzles.\n",
    "    - As you describe things, to them you will both find out if you understand it all correctly.\n",
    "- Navigator: Person who asks questions, points out improvements and helps the driver\n",
    "    - You are viewing the driver's screen and asking questions, making sure that you both understand what the notes are saying.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This methid feels a bit weird on the beginning, but you will really get used to it. It has been used in programming, but also editing text, drawing and other types of pair work. The basic principle is: One person 'holds the pen' and the other person 'asks questions', and then you swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will explain how to setup the remote pair programming workspace, instruct you on how to work together and encourage you to try the roles of driver and navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks in this workshop contain detailed instructions about what to do and when, so you can have a better idea of how this works in practice. There will be less and less scaffolding in future workshops -- it will feel more natural after you've done it a few times. During pair programming workshops, we will typically ask you to switch roles every 15 minutes or so, to make sure that both you and your partner take both roles at least once."

    "Most of the time one of you reads or types much faster than the other one. Or maybe you already grasped a concept that your partner is still digesting. Working together like this is your opportunity to help each other, but also to **understand things better, because you had to explain them to someone**. This is called \"Rubber Ducking\" and is explained more in one of the linked videos on Learn.\n",

    "3. Continue going through this notebook with the other person being the new Driver.\n",
    "\n",
