    "The Roman natural philosopher, Pliny the Elder, purportedly had an intermittent fountain in his garden. As in the following figure, water enters a cylindrical tank at a constant flow rate $Q_{in}$ and fills until the water reaches $y_{high}$. At this point, water siphons out of the tank through a circular discharge pipe, producing a fountain at the pipe's exit. The fountain runs until the water level decreases to $y_{low}$, whereupon the siphon fills with air and the fountain stops. The cycle then repeats as the tank fills unit the water reaches $y_{high}$, and the fountain flows again.\n",

This will produce slightly better results but you need very strict tolerances to get close to the expected behaviour.\n",

    "This difficulty in integrating the equation for Pliny's fountain stems from the fact that the ODE is discontinuous when the siphon switches on or off. For example, when the tank is filling the change in water height depends only on the constant inflow. However, once the water height reaches $y_{high}$ the derivative changes immediately from a positive value to a negative one. While the adaptive step size routines from the default solver handle continuous functions very well, they often struggle with discontinuities. \n",

    "There are a few ways to deal with such discontinuities. One would be to monitor the derivative for a change of sign and to integrate up to the point where the sign changes. This can be done with the SUNDIALS suite of ODE/DAE solvers. The second and in this case arguably simpler method, is to use an integrator with a constant and small step size. The code included above also uses a max step size of $\\Delta t = 0.1$. The plot shows that this integrator produces exactly the expected profile of water heights.\n",

Here the solution is not crashing nor is it producing results which are not possible, e.g. negative water levels, but the solution was nevertheless wrong. So always examine the output with a critical mind and use your engineering knowledge and experience. Also, sometimes the simpler schemes are better than more complex ones. "
