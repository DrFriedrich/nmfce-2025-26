    "- Create more variables to print information about yourselves to get to know each other a little better: where you are from, where you are currently located and what time it is there, what courses you are taking this semester... It's a bit like having a conversation using exclusively `print()` commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also create a new Python notebook: on the main Noteable screen press \"New\" -> \"Python 3\". You can later give it a name under \"File\" -> \"Rename\". Write some code in it and run it. You could create a new script like this to work together on one of the tutorial worksheet problems, for example."
