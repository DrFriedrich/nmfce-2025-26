    "\n",
    "**Bracketing methods** seek to find smaller and smaller **intervals** $[a, b]$ which contain a root.\n",
    "\n",
    "They rely on the Intermediate Value Theorem: for a continuous function $F(x)$, if $F(a)$ has different sign than $F(b)$, then $F(x)$ has a root $x_\\ast \\in [a, b]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bisection\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea: start with an interval $[a, b]$ such that $F(a)$ and $F(b)$ have different signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, split the interval in two, and evaluate $F(\\frac{a+b}{2})$ at the midpoint. Compare the sign of $F(\\frac{a+b}{2})$ with the sign of $F(a)$ and $F(b)$, and choose the half-interval which still contains the root. Repeat the procedure with the new, smaller interval, until convergence.\n",

    "Given a continuous function $F \\left( x \\right)$, if $F \\left( a \\right) \\le 0$ and $F \\left( b \\right) \\ge 0$, the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that there must be a root in the closed interval $\\left[ a, b \\right].$ The bisection method proceeds by testing the **sign** of $F \\left( c \\right)$ where $c$ is the **mid-point** of the interval $\\left[ a, b \\right]$, and uses this to halve the size of the interval in which a root is sought. The process is repeated with the new half-interval, until the interval is small enough to approximate the root with a given tolerance.\n",
